# DiseasePropagator
Create a Disease Propagator for COE 322K C++ End of Year Project

## Understanding the Repo
The code for the project can be found under the [**Source Files**](https://github.com/Kartik-Nagpal/DiseasePropagator/tree/master/Source%20Files) folder above.

To use the code above as a library you must:
* `#include \'propogator.h\'`, and if you would like to directly alter the 'propogator.cpp' file, you can do so in `int main()`
* A Person object can be constructed using the variety of constructors as `Person <name>(string name, [Your choice of additional parameters]);`
* Similarily, a People object can be constructed using the variety of constructors as `People <name>(string name, [Your choice of additional parameters]);`
